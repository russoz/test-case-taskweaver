Run 'dzil test' in the test case directory attached (or available at the git repo:  https://github.com/russoz/test-case-taskweaver )

If the last =pkg is in the form

 =pkg Some::Module 1.234

everything goes smoothly. But if it is in the form:

 =pkg Some::Module 1.234 some reason here

it blows with the message:

Can't locate object method "children" via package "Pod::Elemental::Element::Pod5::Command" at /home/az/perl5/lib/perl5/Pod/Weaver/Plugin/TaskWeaver.pm line 76.
